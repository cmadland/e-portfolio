# Crafting and Implementing Eportfolios at TWU

*Alan Levine's proposal for series of events and activities to advance the practice of building and integrating the TWU Digital Portfolio platform*

Starting in August we have implemented a platform for student electronic portfolios powered by the WordPress platform at http://create.twu.ca. This enables all students and staff to not only create a WordPress site, but to start with a cloned copy of 3 (soon-to-be 4) themed templates that contain the structure and demonstration content to get them started. Having the site is a start; this proposed set of activities is aimed at helping both faculty and students in using the tools, best practices for using media and reflective digital writing, and ideas for faculty to create learning activities that can support ongoing portfolio practice as students move through the Foundations series of courses into their program

**Duration:** October - November 2018

## Activities Proposed

* Continued development and enhancement of the four TWU Portfolio themes creating a directory of additional discipline-specific artifact taxonomies.
* Creation of other copiable pre-populated templates for [SPLOTs](https://splot.ca) and course aggregation hubs
* Development of a syndication platform for aggregating portfolio content for analyzing and highlighting activity across the system
* A series of Technical / Media How To posts on the Portfolios sites https://create.twu.ca/eportfolios/
* A series of live video open discussion sessions on various topics (these will be archived for later viewing), 2 held in October and 4 more as followup to the in person sessions
* Presetation of the project at the 2018 Fall ETUG Workshop (Nov 2)
* A one day series of workshops / discussion in person sessions on topics below at TWU (Nov 5)
* Scheduled ePortfolio review sessions with people who would like to "bring their site into the shop"
* Organizing all activity materials in a "bank" like site like https://extend-bank.ecampusontario.ca

## Tentative Topics

* WordPress Ways: Learn more about using tags, categories, plugins, widgets, featured images, accessibility considerations, using media in your portfolios
* Finding and Using Open Licensed Images - techniques and rationale for not only finding open licensed medua, but also practices of attribution
* Developing Assignments that lend themselves to artifact making
* Assessing Artifacts
* Storytelling approaches to course design
* How e-portfolios fit into the TWU Core Curriculum

## Budget

* Continued Wordpress development and content creation, Oct and Nov at 55% time or $6000 / month
* In Person Visit to include amounts for travel to attend ETUG/TWU (~$380 roundtrip form Regina, 2 nights lodging, local transport,conference registration), preparation time- all inclusive $4000.
