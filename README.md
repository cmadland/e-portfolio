# Crafting and Implementing Eportfolios at TWU

*Alan Levine's proposal for series of events and activities to advance the practice of building and integrating the TWU Digital Portfolio platform*

Starting in August we have implemented a platform for student electronic portfolios powered by the WordPress platform at http://create.twu.ca This enables all students and staff to not only create a WordPress siter, but to start with a cloned copy of 3 themed templates that contains the structure and demonstration content to get them started. Having the site is a start; this proposed set of activities is aimed at helping both faculty and students in using the tools, best practices for using media and reflective digital writing, and ideas for faculty to create learning activities that can support ongoing portfolio practice as students move through the Foundations series of courses into their program

**Duration:** October - November 2018

## Activities Included

* Continued development and enhancement of the four TWO Portfolio themes creating a directory of additional discipline-specific artifact taxonomies.
* Creation of other copiable pre-populated templates for SPLOTs and course aggregation hubs
* Development of a syndication platform for aggregating portfolio content for analyzing and highlighting activity across the system
* A series of Technical / Media How To posts on the Portfolios sites https://create.twu.ca/eportfolios/
